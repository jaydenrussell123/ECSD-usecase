# ECSD-usecase
Use-case for work experience

# Introduction
The code in this repo uses a certain format to sort files into correct and incorrect, numerically. When the code is first printed with all the files, it will give you 4 sections. The first section will list your directory (if there is no directory, it will tell you then exit the program), the second lists every file before it is sorted, the third will list the correct files sorted into numerical order, and the 4th will do the same, but for incorrect files.

# How to use
Run ``./usecase.py <dir to sql files>``
